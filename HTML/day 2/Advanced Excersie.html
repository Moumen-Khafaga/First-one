<h2><em>united saters thank the fans for the supportem</em></h2>
<article>
	<p>Paul Pogba joined his Manchester United team-mates in thanking the club's supporters via social media when he posted a positive message on Monday afternoon. The fans were praised for backing the Reds during Sunday's difficult 1-1 draw against old rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford, with Pogba commenting on Instagram: "This is when we need to be strong. Iâ€™m here, ready to fight and ready for the next one!!! I'd like to thank the supporters who are always there and keep believing in me. At least we did not lose. Never stop fighting." <br /> <br />
	 Ander Herrera played a full match in central midfield and the Spaniard later posted: "United never give up! It was a shame not getting the three points for our fans. Let's think about the next one." Anthony Martial also used social media to write: "Thanks again to ALL the @ManUtd supporters for this incredible atmosphere. We didn't get the win but your support was amazing!!" In-form goalkeeper David De Gea used his official Twitter account to say: "Spectacular atmosphere at Old Trafford! Great team effort until the end! We couldn't make it today but we'll try again on Saturday!" Energetic left-back Matteo Darmian tweeted this message of thanks: "Tough match! Like always our fans were amazing! It's a pleasure playing for you!" <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Phil Jones and Henrikh Mkhitaryan both mentioned the supporters in their post-match interviews on MUTV and credited them for helping United fight back to equalise through Zlatan Ibrahimovic, after Liverpool's James Milner had converted the first-half penalty given against Pogba for handball. "The fans spurred us on," said Jones. "You could hear them throughout the game. Even when we were 1-0 down, they were terrific. They helped us get that equaliser, the place erupted when Ibra scored, it absolutely erupted." Mkhitaryan added: "The atmosphere was amazing. I want to see more of this kind of atmosphere in the stadium. Thanks to the supporters. They were believing in us and they supported us until the end."</p>
